# Yogurt Fermentation Monitoring with IoT
The primary objective of this project is to monitor the yogurt fermentation process through the utilization of an IoT device. The fermentation process will be tracked in real-time using pH, TDS, and TEMP sensors. Nutritional values of milk and yogurt culture features will be provided by the user. 

The sensor data will be transmitted by IoT device to the cloud environment. Following this, yogurt fermentation experiments will be conducted for data collection. Using this data, a machine learning model will be trained to predict the remaining time required for the yogurt to ferment.

For the graphical user interface (GUI), both web and mobile applications will be made available, allowing users to track the yogurt fermentation process. The system will send notifications to users based on predefined thresholds set by the user.
